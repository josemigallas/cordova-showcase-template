## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed in your machine:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version 8.9.4
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) - version 3.20.0
- [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) - version 8.0.0


# Developing the Cordova Showcase Application Template for testing new SDK features
Note: Work completed on un released SDK features should never be merged to `master` all experimental work should be merged to `development` branch only.

## Cloning the repository

You will first need to clone [Aerogear JS SDK](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js-sdk):
```
git clone git@github.com:aerogear/aerogear-js-sdk.git
```
Next, clone the showcase app directly into the SDK:
```
cd aerogear-js-sdk
git clone git@github.com:aerogear/cordova-showcase-template.git cordova-example
```

## Build the SDK repository
 
From the SDK dir run the following to build and link the dependencies:
```
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

## Build the showcase application

To build the application:
```
cd cordova-example
npm install 
npm run build
```

## Link required packages

To work with development versions of the libraries use link command.
For example:

```
npm link @aerogear/app @aerogear/auth @aerogear/security @aerogear/core
```

> NOTE: You can also use `npm run linkDev`

## Run showcase app

To run the application enter one of the following:
```
npm run ionic:android 
npm run ionic:ios 
```
> **Note**: To run the app in an emulator, you must have an emulator currently running when entering the above command.

## Work with Different Backend Services

By default the app will use the backend services that are running on [a dedicated OpenShift cluster](https://security.skunkhenry.com:8443) for demonstration purpose.

You can also configure the app to run against different backend services:

1. Update the URLs in [mobile-services.json](src/mobile-services.json) file.
2. If you are using HTTPS, update the SHA1 fingerprint of the server certificate configuration in the [mobile-services.json](src/mobile-services.json) file.

To generate the SHA1 hash value of the certificate, you can use this command:
```
openssl s_client -servername <hostname> -connect <hostname:port> -showcerts < /dev/null 2>/dev/null   | openssl x509 -in /dev/stdin -sha1 -noout -fingerprint
```
